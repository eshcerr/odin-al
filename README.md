# odin-al
OpenAL wrapper for Odin

Currently only working on windows.

I recommend cloning this repo into Odin's shared collection
```bash
cd Odin/shared
git clone https://github.com/thebirk/odin-al.git
```

And then include it using

```go
import "shared:odin-al/al.odin"
import "shared:odin-al/alc.odin"
```
